# Teaching Inclusive Design

_Published: November 15, 2024_

A short summary of how I structure my course on accessibility and what students take away from it.

```js
// Example snippet
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('student'));
```

> Inclusive design is about making products usable by as many people as possible.
